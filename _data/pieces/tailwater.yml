  intro: Tailwater Outdoors is a small company based out of Ottawa that creates handmade fishing nets. Until now they had no brand image and no online presence, so when they approached me these two things were the main focus of the project. Tailwater creates stunning wooden nets that are the ideal product for those who truly love to fish, so the brand identity and web store I designed for them were created to let the amazing products they produce have their own voice.
