intro: Preserve the Tiger is a clothing company that was started by an Ottawa local to support the preservstion of wild tigers worldwide. I built their branding and website, as well as their products, to attract a young demographic to the cause of helping tigers while also getting them excited about the streetwear based garments they sell. We're helping save tigers and looking good doing it. <a href="https://preservethetiger.com">Check out the live website</a>
