I really have no idea why I design stuff, but that's one of the reasons I keep pushing myself. I'm still trying to figure out what it is that drives me to create design and art that speaks to an audience, that outshines the competition.
I do know one thing for sure - I will work closely with my clients until I create a design solution that grows their business and makes them proud of the brand they built.
